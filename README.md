### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


[![Irene's GitHub Banner](/address)]

My name is Jinhee (Irene) Choi. 

I was an accountant in Real Estate Investment, sales and Insurance industry before :grin:. As I was constantly involved in improving company's performance, I became very interested in how to analyze and utilize data more effectively and apply it to the real world. So I studied Data Science/ Data Analysis and I am now a Data Scientist/Data Analyst! 

Want to know more about me?
